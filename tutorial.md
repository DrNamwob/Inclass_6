# Learning to add

Introduction: In this tutorial you will learn the essential skill of adding, using the function my_adder.

Prerequisites: As usual, a willingness to learn. Coffee is optional, but strongly encouraged.

Step-by-step instructions: First, let's start with something easy. 

Let's add 4029304421, 230503234, and 2340099661.

Let's assign each of these to their own variable:

`a = 4029304421 `
`b = 230503234 `
`c = 2340099661 `

Using the my_adder function (see below), we can add these together lickity-split.

`lickity_split = my_adder(a,b,c)`

`print(lickity_split)`

Recap: If you followed along closely, you can rest assured you know how to add.  If you're still not sure how to add, you didn't pay close enough attention. Shame! Shame!
